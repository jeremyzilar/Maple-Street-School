				<h4>Design by Cooperation</h4>
				<p>We believe the digital experience of an organization should embody the values and principles of the organization it represents â€” right down to the way it's built and organized.</p>

				<p>That is why we have designed a process to keep the cooperative spirit engaged every step of the way.</p>

				<p>In the coming weeks, we will be launching a Coop-wide survey and a new blog to include you in the design process. Stay tuned!</p>
